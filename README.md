# Scheduling-Application

## Introduction ##
This application provides a user-friendly interface for managing customer data and scheduling appointments efficiently. The application pulls data from a MySQL database that has been provided by the consulting organization.

## Description ##
The application comes with several features, including the ability to add, update, and delete customer records, as well as appointments, capturing the type of appointment and a link to the specific customer record in the database. The application also provides the ability to view the calendar by month and by week, adjust appointment times based on user time zones and daylight saving time, and generate reports on appointment types and schedules for consultants.

The application also includes features for preventing scheduling conflicts and data entry errors, such as scheduling appointments outside business hours, scheduling overlapping appointments, entering nonexistent or invalid customer data, and entering an incorrect username and password.

Additionally, the application provides a log-in form that can determine the userâ€™s location and translate log-in and error control messages into two languages. The application also includes lambda expressions to make the program more efficient, and an alert feature that notifies users of appointments within 15 minutes of log-in.

Finally, the application provides the ability to track user activity by recording timestamps for user log-ins in a .txt file.
